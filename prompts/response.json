            "description": "The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain, responsible for higher-level cognitive functions such as thinking, perceiving, and understanding language.",
            "impact": "Alcohol disrupts communication between neurons in the cerebrum, leading to impaired judgment, reduced inhibitions, and difficulty with decision-making. It also affects motor coordination and sensory perception.",
            "symptoms": ["Impaired judgment", "Reduced coordination", "Slurred speech"]

            "part": "Cerebellum",
            "description": "The cerebellum is crucial for motor control, coordination, and balance.",
            "impact": "Alcohol significantly impairs cerebellar function, resulting in poor balance, unsteady gait, and difficulty with fine motor skills. This is why field sobriety tests often assess balance and coordination.",

            "description": "The brainstem controls essential bodily functions like breathing, heart rate, and consciousness.",
            "impact": "High levels of alcohol can depress the brainstem's function, potentially leading to slowed breathing, decreased heart rate, and even loss of consciousness. In extreme cases, this can be fatal.",

            "description": "The frontal lobe is responsible for executive functions, including planning, decision-making, and impulse control.",
            "impact": "Alcohol impairs the frontal lobe's ability to regulate behavior, leading to impulsive actions, poor judgment, and difficulty controlling emotions. It also affects short term memory.",

            "part": "Parietal Lobe",
            "description": "The parietal lobe processes sensory information, including touch, temperature, and pain.",
            "impact": "Alcohol can distort sensory perception in the parietal lobe, leading to altered sensations and impaired spatial awareness. This can affect reaction time.",
